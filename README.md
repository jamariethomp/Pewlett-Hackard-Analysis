# Computer Company Workforce Analysis

## Overview

With a large wave of Baby Boomers preparing to exit the workforce, employers must prepare for major changes to their labor pools by preparing retirement packages for retirees, promoting from within to fill senior-level positions, and filling entry-level positions with new hires. This analysis seeks to assist Pewlett Hackard Inc. in determining 1) which positions will be vacated by retiring staff and 2) which employees are eligible to participate in its mentorship program.

## Results

 - Out of the approximately 70,000 staff preparing to exit the company, 50,000 are senior engineers and other senior staff; the remaining 20,000 are mid-to-entry-level staff:

- Approximately 40,000 of the soon-to-be-vacant positions require some degree of technical engineering proficiency.

- There are currently approximately 240,000 employees working at Pewlett Hackard; with 70,000 leaving, this leaves at least 170,000 potentially eligible for promotion.

- There are currently 1,549 employees eligibile to participate in the company's mentorship program.

## Summary

- At the onset of the upcoming wave of retirements at Pewlett Hackard, it appears that some-70,000 positions will be vacated. The company will need to engage in significant planning in order to fill many senior-level positions (and, by most likely, many entry-level positions as current employees move up).
- With 70,000 potential vacancies and 1,500 employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program, the number of potential mentors falls far short of the number of mid-level employees in need of mentorship. It would be prudent for Pewlett Hackard to procure some mentorship services from outside the company in order to prime its up-and-coming employees for senior-level positions.
- In order to determine the number of employees in Pewlett Hackard who are potentially eligible for promotion, a SQL query can filter the number of employees not yet eligible for retirement. A potential SQL query may look like the following:

- One way the Pewlett Hackard might promote diversity is by moving more women into high-level roles. With the data at hand, a SQL query can tell us the number of men and women leaving the pool of soon-to-be-vacant positions:
